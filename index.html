				<p>	The two types of bullying include:</p>
				<p>	<b>Direct bullying</b>: bullying in the presence of a targeted person.
			<b>Indirect bullying</b>: bullying not directly communicated to a targeted youth. </p>
	<p> 	The four types of bullying are physical, verbal, relational, and damage to property. </p>
	<p> 	The reasons for being bullied are most often because of physical appearance, race/ethnicity, gender, disability, religion, or sexual orientation.</p>
<p> Students who are both targets of bullying and engage in bullying behavior are at greater risk for both mental health and behavior problems than students who only bully or are only bullied. </p>
<p> Students who bully others, are bullied, or witness bullying are more likely to report high levels of suicide-related behavior than students who report no involvement in bullying.</p>
<p> Students who experience bullying are twice as likely as non-bullied peers to experience negative health effects such as headaches and stomachaches. </p>

					<h3 class="sp-title">Step Three: Reach Out To The Victim</h3>
					<p>Victims of bullying often spend years minimizing the bullying, dismissing it or pretending it didn’t happen. Or, they succumb to feelings of guilt, shame or self-blame, believing if they had been different or tried harder the bullying would not have happened. But let's not let that happen! Here are some ways you can help!</p>

									<h4>Write</h4>
									<p>Have the victim write down their emotions.
Identify areas where they need to grow or heal. Writing down their emotions can help them gain control of their thoughts and improve their mental health. Victims can gain self awareness, clarify their feelings and explore deep thoughts in a free space. Likewise it gives them a space to track their progress towards healing. Writing is a great theraputic method because it helps the victim manage and learn from their negative experiences and write ways to become stronger and improve their health.
 </p>
								</div>

							<div class="col-md-6">
								<div class="icon-box">
									<i class="flaticon-map"></i>
									<h4>Give Professional Support</h4>
									<p>A good therapist can help a victim cope with feelings, problem solve and change behavior patterns that may contribute to a victim's symptoms. Remind the victim therapy is not just talking about their problems. Therapy involves working towards solutions, defining triggers, establishing a stable routine, clarifying feelings, and creating a plan for coping and recovery. Because of our social nature and the way our brains work, we can be helped and healed just by experiencing a caring human relationship. Therefore therapy is recommended for every victim. </p>

							<div class="col-md-6">
								<div class="icon-box">
									<i class="flaticon-phone-call"></i>
									<h4>Check-ins</h4>
									<p>Checking in with the victim can be difficult if the victim does not trust you, however reminding the victim you are there for them and support them, is a great step. Victims often feel like their alone in bullying situations, but periodic check-ins can remind the victim they are not alone in this problem. They have someone on their side which is a huge deal. Remember not to force anything, if the victim is uncomfrotable with you, find another adult they trust so they can check in on the victim.  </p>
								</div>
							</div>
							<div class="col-md-6">
								<div class="icon-box">
									<i class="flaticon-heart"></i>
									<h4>Re-Build</h4>
									<p>Give the power back to the victim. Bullying often causes people to lose confidence and self-esteem because it is packed with lies about a victim's worth as a person. Have the victim reject the lies that the bully said and replace them with the truth about who they are. If a victim continues to stay in a victim state they will stay stuck as a victim. Have the victim acknowledge what happened to them. Make them realize that while they cannot control what happened to them, they can control their reaction. Start their recovery by having them take control of their thoughts, emotions and actions and making healthier choices.</p>
